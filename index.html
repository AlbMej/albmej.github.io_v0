        <p id = "title" >Undergraduate Researcher</p>
        <p>I am contributing to a new area of research called Machine Teaching. This research project focuses on teaching an instructable agent through natural language and dialogue.</p>
        <p>I work on the research project as part of the Dialogue Engine Team. My task is to research and implement Natural Language Generation models using Policy Learning and Action Space Forming.</p>

        <p id = "title" >Software Development Intern at IBM</p>
        <p> 06/2018 - 08/2018 <p>
        <p>PROJECT DEFINITION: Involved analyzing customer feedback, reviewing designs from the UX team, and implementing those designs as Modern InFlight screens. The process in doing this was as follows: Take one improvement feature, design a solution, code the solution to completion, and produce production ready code. </p>
		<p>PROJECT DELIVERABLES: The implemented usability improvements consisted of reduced clicks, labels, and simplification of data presentation within modern InFlight.</p>
		<p>PROJECT TAKEAWAYS: 
		<ul>• Acquired a basic understanding of usability and design elements that shapes user experience.</ul>
		<ul>• Learned the importance of visibility tools in providing clients exposure to data processing within the IBM cloud.</ul>
		<ul>• Gained experience of working with EDI technology and working on a real product with an Agile development process.</ul>

        <p>I was one of 27 attendees selected out of 900+ applicants to attend a five-day interactive program for first-year computer science majors focused on professional and technical development including coding, networking, personal branding, resume writing,interview skills. </p>
        <p>I worked with a team of 6 to create a new tweet feature, named Tweet Time, based on our developed design document. The project was later presented to many engineers, mentors, and participants; including Twitter CEO, Jack Dorsey, and Vice President of Engineering, Nandini Ramani.</p>

        <p id = "date">January 2019 - Present</p>
        <p>Technologies Used: Django, Bootstrap</p>
        <p>I am currently leading and managing a team of 6 to create an open source web-based application that populates your calendar with upcoming deadlines and activities.</p>
        <p>As well as managing the projects direction, I am also a developer for the back-end. Currently, I am researching and implementing algorithms for extracting important information from the PDFs of syllabuses/schedules. </p>
        <p>You can follow the progress of this open source project on my GitHub.</p>

        <p id = "date">May 2016 - Present</p>
        <p>Technologies Used: Python</p>
        <p>I implemented depth-first search, breadth-first search, uniform cost search, and A* search algorithms to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the Pacman world.</p>
        <p>This Pacman game is modeled as both an adversarial and a stochastic search problem. I implemented multiagent Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning, and Expectimax algorithms, as well as designing and implemented evaluation functions.</p>

        <p id = "date">June 2018</p>
        <p>Technologies Used: Python, Tensorflow</p> 
        <p>Words are mapped to vectors of real numbers using Word2Vec and are trained using NCE Loss. TSNE is used to reduce the dimensionality of the vectors to a two dimensional space in order to be able to visualize them. The word embeddings are then plotted on a scatterplot using matplotlib to display the word relationships.</p>

        <p>Built using only HTML,CSS, and Javascript. Deployed and hosted using Jekyll and Github Pages.</p>
        <p>The purpose of this project was to enhance my digital footprint, have a place to showcase my work, and learn new skills.</p>

        <p id = "date">May 2016</p>
        <p>Technologies Used: Arduino, C</p>
        <p>For my Senior Tech Prep project I built a prosthetic and combined it with a Myoware Muscle Sensor. The sensor interprets the electrical signals from muscles and produces a Simple Analog Signal. From theses Analog inputs, the Pulse Width Modulation pins on an Arduino simulate an analog output, controlling servos placed in the forearm.</p>
        <p>The purpose of this project was to combat the expensive myoelectric prosthetics on the market and offer those in third world countries access to what may be considered a luxury.</p>
